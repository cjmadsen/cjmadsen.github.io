title: I'm still working on getting my online presence up, but in the meantime here's a little about me
---
I'm fascinated by decision-making and how impactful its application can be. At my core I'm a behavioral economist interested in helping make better choices. Simplistically, I find decision-making can be broken down into two parts: information, and what to do with it. With data science, I start at the beginning, working with data to see what insight we can draw from it. This augments my degree in Math and Economics, which focused more on the end of the decision process, using those insights to make optimal choices. By making me more robust at taking data and turning it into usable information and recommendations, I've acquired a complete decision-making skill set. My aim is to work in a role that lets me be a part of making smart and strategic choices.
